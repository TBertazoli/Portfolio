# Portfolio

## Description

Welcome to my portfolio! Here, I showcase a selection of projects Iâ€™ve developed throughout my career. This website was built using the Next.js framework and is hosted on Vercel. It features an "About Me" section with my photo and a brief introduction, as well as a "Portfolio" section highlighting some of my projects, each with a link to the live application and its GitHub repository. Additionally, you can find a downloadable PDF version of my resume.
