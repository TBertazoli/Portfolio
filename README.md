# Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio is where I showcase some of the projects that I have developed over the course of my career. This project was created with Next.js framework and deployed at vercel.com. The website has an about me section with my image and a little description about myself and a portfolio section with some of my projects. When you click on an specific project you will see a modal with a description of the project a link to git hub repository and if clicked on the image it will take you to the deployed website. You can also see a pdf version of my resume.
